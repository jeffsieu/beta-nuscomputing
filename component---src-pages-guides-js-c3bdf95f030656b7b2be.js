For example, if you get 4 B, 3 B+, and 3 A- (CAP 3.95 before S/U), you more or less can tell you'll either get a Distinction or Merit.

Since you're unsure, your B+ could either pull your CAP up, or down, depending on what class you eventually fall into. Further, your B+ will not hurt your chances of attaining a Distinction (neither will it improve).

Extrapolating will get you 2 A-, 4 B+, and 4 B in your 1st year. You will likely S/U your Bs. Whether you want to S/U your B+ will again depend on how confident you are of doing better in future.
